# Smart Cat Feeder

A smart cat feeder, an "upgrade" from the [feeder on
Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8175), using an ESP32-S3
Dev board -- a more powerful processor. It will have a touch screen, and
provide a web server over WiFi. It will use a load cell to measure how full
the food bowl is, it will have a sensor to check when the food bin is low and
have a battery backup to operate in the event of a power failure, to insure
your cat will be fed when the power goes out.
