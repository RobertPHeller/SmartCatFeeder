# Smart Cat Feeder

A smart cat feeder, an "upgrade" from the feeder on Thingiverse.com, using an 
ESP32-S2 Dev board -- a more powerful processor.  It will have a touch screen,
and provide a web server over WiFi.  It will use a load cell to measure how 
full the food bowl is, it will have a sensor to check when the food bin is low
and have a battery backup to operate in the event of a power failure, to 
insure your cat will be feed when the power goes out.
